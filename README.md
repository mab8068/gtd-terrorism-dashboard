# Global Terrorism Database Visualization

**Course:** SRA 268 (Spring 2025)  
**Tool:** Tableau  
**Dataset:** Global Terrorism Database (GTD), START Consortium, 1970–2017

## Overview

This project analyzes ~180,000 global terrorism incident records to identify high-level patterns in attack frequency, geographic distribution, attack methods, and perpetrator groups.

Three coordinated visualizations were designed to communicate key findings to a non-technical audience:

1. **Attacks Over Time by Region** – Line chart showing trends in South Asia, Middle East, and other regions
2. **Most Common Attack Types** – Horizontal bar chart highlighting bombings as the predominant method
3. **Top Terrorist Groups** – Vertical bar chart showing concentration of attacks among few groups

Gestalt principles (continuity, similarity, figure/ground) were applied to improve visual clarity and guide viewer attention.

## Key Findings

- South Asia and the Middle East experienced the highest volume of terrorist attacks (1970–2017)
- Bombings/explosions account for the majority of incidents globally
- A small number of groups are responsible for a disproportionate share of attacks

## Files
